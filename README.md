# 🌍 Predicting and Classifying World Happiness Scores using Machine Learning

This project analyzes the **World Happiness Report** data to identify key factors influencing global happiness, using machine learning techniques such as regression, classification, and clustering.

## 📌 Overview

The **World Happiness Report** ranks countries based on several socio-economic and health-related metrics. This project uses these metrics to:
- Predict happiness scores using regression models.
- Classify countries into happiness tiers (High, Medium, Low).
- Cluster nations into groups based on similar happiness and economic indicators.

## 📊 Features Used
- GDP per capita
- Social support
- Healthy life expectancy
- Freedom to make life choices
- Perceptions of corruption
- Generosity

## 🧠 Machine Learning Techniques
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation analysis
- Happiness score distribution
- Insight into feature relationships

### 2. Clustering
- K-Means Clustering to group countries into 4 clusters
- Visualized with scatter plots and cluster centroids

### 3. Regression Analysis
- Linear Regression model
- **R² Score**: 0.60  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 0.41

### 4. Classification
- Logistic Regression to classify countries into:
  - High Happiness
  - Medium Happiness
  - Low Happiness
- **Accuracy**: 87.5%

## 📈 Visualizations
Visuals were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to enhance understanding of patterns and model performance.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🔮 Future Work
- Incorporate additional features (education, mental health, environment)
- Use advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks)
- Improve classification accuracy for the "Medium" happiness tier
